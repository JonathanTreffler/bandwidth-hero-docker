# Bandwidth Hero Docker
A docker image for the [Bandwidth Hero Proxy](https://github.com/ayastreb/bandwidth-hero-proxy).

Bandwidth Hero can be hosted with Heroku or self hosted with Dokku, but Dokku has a big overhead if you don't already use it and Heroku Free might not have enough resources for some applications. So i created this pure Docker Image, thats very easy to set up.
